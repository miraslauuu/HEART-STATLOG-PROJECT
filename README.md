# Heart Disease Prediction Project (Statlog Heart)

**Author:** Miraslau Alkhovk, 248655, Lodz University of Technology

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a classification model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on medical data. The *Statlog (Heart)* dataset contains 270 records with information such as age, gender, type of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol level, ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, and other significant features. The target variable `presence` indicates whether heart disease is present (1 = no disease, 2 = disease).

## Project Contents

- **Source Code:**  
  A notebook (`heart_statlog.ipynb`) that includes:
  - Data import and exploration.
  - Data cleaning and statistical analysis.
  - Visualization of relationships between features (correlation plots, box plots, heatmap).
  - Building classification models:
    - Logistic Regression.
    - Decision Tree.
  - Model evaluation (confusion matrices, classification reports).

## Requirements

The project is implemented in Python. The required libraries are:
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation and Running

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miraslauuu/heart.git
